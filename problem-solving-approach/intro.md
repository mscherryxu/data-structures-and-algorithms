# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm
  - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
  - It's the **foundation** for being a successful problem solving and developer
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## How do you improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
   - Understand the problem
   - Explore concrete examples
   - Break it down
   - Solve/simplify
   - Look back and refactor
   - Strategies are adapted from George Polya's book - How To Solve It - great resource for anyone who wants to become a better problem solver
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can outputs be determined from inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
   - It's okay to not be able to answer this question until you start solving the problem.
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Write a function which takes 2 numbers and returns their sum.
