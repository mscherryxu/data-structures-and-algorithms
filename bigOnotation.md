# The Big O Notation

## Objectives

- Describe what it is
  - It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
  - Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
  - When your code slows down or crashs, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us with pain points in our applications
- Simplify big O expressions
- Time complexity and space complexity
  - Faster?
  - Less memory-intensive?
  - The problem with time
    - Different machines will record different times
    - The same machine will record different times
    - For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough
  - If not time, then what?
    - Count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform!
