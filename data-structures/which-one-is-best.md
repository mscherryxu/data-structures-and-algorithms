# Which Data Structure is the Best?

There is no best one! They all excel in different environments.

## What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Why so many?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

## Why care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.

You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

## Working with map/location data?

Use a graph!

## Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?

Use a linked list!

## Web scraping nested HTML?

Use a tree!

## Need to write a scheduler?

Use a binary heap!
